# RockPaperScissorsJS

Don't worry, this isn't another framework.

_but it's indeed yet another beginner mini-project_

This project marks the beginning of my journey into learning Full-Stack development.
I figured it was best for me to make and not put any effort, more than required, like refactorings. I know the code is ugly, but should I worry about it since it works as intended, or should I because I know there are many better ways to write code?
Perhaps, as I gain more experience, I'll return to this piece of code, and if I do, I'll likely find it amusing and cringe at myself.

My goal was to make this mini-project without cheating or copy/pasting, which I succeeded.

# Possible refactorings

I know these are easy, but I don't want to waste my time on these since I can use that time to learn more and always come back to it later.

- Functions are gross, they could use some seperation
- Could display the round winning move.
